#### Development environment setup for practice
- https://github.com/slipp/web-application-server Fork the project into your own account. If you click the Fork button on the top right of Github, it will be forked to your own account.
- Clone the forked project.
- Create my new repository.
- Link the cloned project with the newly created repository.
- try a build

#### Start and test the web server
- webserver.WebServer is a class that receives user requests and delegates tasks to RequestHandler.
- All processing of user requests is handled by the run() method of the RequestHandler class.
- After running the WebServer, connect to http://localhost:9090 in the browser and check if the "Hello World" message is displayed.

#### The code is gradually improved through a refactoring process.
- The goal is to start refactoring from the step1-bad branch and improve the spring mvc structure.
